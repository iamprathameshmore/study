## Introduction

C and C++ are powerful, high-performance programming languages widely used for system/software development, game development, and performance-critical applications. C is procedural, while C++ supports object-oriented programming and other modern features.

## Comparison Between C and C++

| Feature              | C                                      | C++                                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Paradigm**         | Procedural                              | Multi-paradigm (Procedural, OOP, Generic) |
| **Typing**           | Static and Strong                      | Static and Strong                      |
| **Memory Management**| Manual (using malloc/free)             | Manual and Automatic (using new/delete, smart pointers) |
| **Standard Library** | Limited (Standard I/O, string handling) | Extensive (STL, algorithms, containers) |
| **Object-Oriented**  | Not supported                           | Supported (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism) |
| **Templates**        | Not supported                           | Supported (Templates, Generics)        |
| **Exception Handling**| Not supported                           | Supported (try/catch/finally)          |
| **Concurrency**      | Limited (POSIX threads)                 | Advanced (std::thread, std::async)     |
